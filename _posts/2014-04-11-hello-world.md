The 2014 <a href="http://www.healthdataconsortium.org/">HealthDataConsortium's</a> HealthDataPalooza is this June in DC, and the Code-a-thon was launched last with week.  This year <a href="http://www.healthdataconsortium.org/challenges/announcing-the-code-a-palooza-challenge-at-health-datapalooza-2014">the focus</a> is on how independant developers can leverage the massive <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Physician-and-Other-Supplier.html">CMS patient claims and physician reimbursement data</a> recently released.

Already many journalists and <a href="http://omni.docgraph.org/">health data junkies</a> have already started pouring through the nearly 9 million records looking for trends and insights that may benefit patients, payers and providers alike.  

So it's official, I have started a team as well and we are beginning to kick around ideas, looking at data sets and talking logistics.  Transparency is the name of the game, so I'll be writing when I can about our experiences, insights, questions, tools, technology, and well, everything.  I'm particularly excited for the technical journey, and documenting that as much as possible so others may follow our path.

We have a few goals in mind, beyond pure health data discovery:

1. Have Fun:  It's important to show others, especially non-health-data-geeks that this can be an enjoyable initiative. Yes, we nerd out, but it's not all TNG and pizza. 

2. Be Democratic: Also important is educating others so that this may be accomplished by "normal" people.  We are not professional programmers exactly, but we do have a vested interest in data. We feel it's important to highlight that together our different backgrounds can create a whole greater than the sum of our parts, and that the tools used to accomplish this are widely available to the greater public.

3. Learn Something: Me? I need to brush up on R, and webdev. Nick is a complete newb to the healthcare scene.  Mandi is looking forward to technical nuts and bolts. We all have vastly different backgrounds and talents, and it will be interesting to feed off of each other.

4. Provide Value: Core to this initiative is the opportunity to provide real value and insight to the greater healthcare community and the patients involved.

5. Win Big: Let's be honest, now, cash money potential has crossed our minds.

Beyond this, we are pretty open.  There's a lot to discover, and we will take the next two weeks kicking around broad hypothesis before narrowing things down for a formal proposal.  

I will try to expand more on our team, and what everyone brings to the table, but for now, meet:

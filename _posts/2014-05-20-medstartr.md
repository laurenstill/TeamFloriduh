Things are starting to take shape for the TeamFloriduh team.  We have just over 10 days to go before showtime, and are refining models, our renderings, annoying CSS and fine tuning a pitch.  We've been looking closely at incorporating the BlueButton API, or possibly Direct protocol for patient data V/D/T. We're holding off on both (as of this writing, who knows what will happen tomorrow) until we can confidently button everything up with proper data encryption.  

In addition to this, we've started planning for some long(er) term hosting, CPT code licensing, travel, competent webdev outsourcing, data costs and more.  To help with these expenses, and to launch the long term FloriData plan, we've taken to [MedStartr][2].

You can help us out by donating, spreading our message, or just sending some warm vibes our way [here][2]. 

As always, follow [TeamFloriduh][1] on Twitter or visit [teamfloriduh.com][4] for updates and for more information on [HealthDatapalooza][3], visit healthdatapalooza.org.

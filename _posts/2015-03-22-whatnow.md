In some ways it seems significantly longer but it’s just nearing a year since [#TeamFloriduh][1] materialized and many things have changed with the tribe. Definitely older, questionably wiser, and in many ways smarter we are anticipating the 2015 [HealthDatapalooza][2] and all its ruckus glory. So, how about that update?

Mandi has joined [DellHealthcare][3] as Analytics Innovations & Consulting Practice Lead while Nick has joined the ranks of [Socratica][4] doing his data science thing. Together they still bring a great balance of technical depth and industry expertise and the dichotomy between personalities and skillsets has only fed more energy into our goals for FloriData.

As for me? I’ve gone full [#HITpol][5] at [DICOMGrid][6] and have been navigating the merger between the FDA regulatory body and scrappy health IT start-up mentality. It’s been the best of both worlds working as a mediator between a great engineering team and federal policy requirements, and I like to think for once I am making both sides pretty happy.  

So what’s up next for #TeamFloriduh? We’ve been keeping an eye out on identifying disparities in healthcare, since knowing is half the battle. We’re watching a few different projects, namely [Stanford MedX][7] | [Symplur][8] data challenge, [VA Care Coordination for Improved Outcomes][9] and a few of the [California Healthcare Foundation][10] initiatives. We’ll be submitting research proposals in the very near future and we’re looking forward to connecting with all of the [#HITsm][11] crew at [HIMSS][12] and more. Crowdsourcing innovation at its finest!
  
More to come!

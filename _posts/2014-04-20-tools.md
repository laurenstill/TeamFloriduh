Short post for now, but we are building a collection of resources and tools to help others learn and understand what we have done, and the technology behind it. This will be cataloged under the <a href="teamfloriduh.com/resources">Resources</a> section of this site.  Hopefully, as we progress, will be be able to include tutorials, and examples based on the available Medicare data.  

We are looking forward to finalizing our plan, and abstract for submission on Friday.  #TeamFloriduh

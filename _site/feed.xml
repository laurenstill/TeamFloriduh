      <description>&lt;p&gt;Short post for now, but we are building a collection of resources and tools to help others learn and understand what we have done, and the technology behind it. This will be cataloged under the &lt;a href='teamfloriduh.com/resources'&gt;Resources&lt;/a&gt; section of this site. Hopefully, as we progress, will be be able to include tutorials, and examples based on the available Medicare data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to finalizing our plan, and abstract for submission on Friday. #TeamFloriduh&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting a benchmark understanding about how larger datasets behave can be difficult, especially when using new tools and technology. It’s important to get some basic clustering and visualization to understand the big picture before diving in. Today, we tested a few hypotheses that we could &lt;em&gt;reasonably&lt;/em&gt; expect to prove positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure there are no surprises with the base case before adding on layers of complexity or information sets. For this initial investigation, we pushed the CMS data into a SQLite database, and ran some basic analysis with the R programing language. Specifically, we looked at the Medicare reimbursements and how they related to provider sex, age and race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, there was no significant difference in bill-out rates based on sex (looking at all the data), and it was the same with the reimbursement rate. This was confirmed with private data for race and age. Turns out, our government is pretty unbiased in how it pays out, and that’s worthy a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Look</title>
      <link>http://teamfloriduh.com/2014/04/13/first-look/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://teamfloriduh.com/2014/04/13/first-look</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week (April 9, 2014) CMS continued showing unprecedented transparency by releasing &lt;a href='https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Physician-and-Other-Supplier.html'&gt;Medicare payer information data&lt;/a&gt; for the 2012 year. This dataset, 9M records in total, includes physician names and addresses in addition to CPT code frequencies over 10. For patient data security, it does not include payment data for less frequent treatments. Chances are, if you are a physician who has provided care to a medicare recipient in 2012, your billing information is included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government data disclosure has &lt;a href='http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/doctors-protest-CMS-data-release'&gt;raised plenty of eyebrows&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from physicians and provider advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe that the broad data dump (Wednesday) by CMS has significant shortcomings regarding the accuracy and value of the medical services rendered by physicians,” said Ardis Dee Hoven, MD, president of the AMA, in a statement. “Releasing the data without context will likely lead to inaccuracies, misinterpretations, false conclusions and other unintended consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still others in industry question what value “normal” people would find in such a data dump, without the skillsets necessary to process information appropriately. Personally, this seems akin to doctors who don’t trust that patients can understand disease management or critically evaluate treatment options or diagnostic information. This information is another important step towards defining the “cost”, “value”, and “price” parameters in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our team dug into the CMS data set for the first time on Monday, and the shortcomings became abundantly clear. The yearly aggregated data came with significant limitations. As the brainstorming session went on, it became more and more apparent that any data trend analysis would have to wait, and we would have to focus on geographic parameters, and publically available heatmap data. In addition to this, the amount of clean up necessary is staggering: cities spelled differently, missing fields, conflicting demographic information, and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMS is specifically looking to fraud detection, and consumer tools, but has tied independent developer’s hands by not providing granular data which could be married with weather, CDC/NIH or other time-based statistics. While this and other data dumps are a start, it is only a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago the means for complex data analysis were not accessible to “normal” people, but that is no longer the case. The private sector has come through, and provided access to the tools necessary for individual critical analysis. It’s important to support the public sector in meeting the community halfway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello World!</title>
      <link>http://teamfloriduh.com/2014/04/11/hello-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://teamfloriduh.com/2014/04/11/hello-world</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2014 &lt;a href='http://www.healthdataconsortium.org/'&gt;HealthDataConsortium’s&lt;/a&gt; HealthDataPalooza is this June in DC, and the Code-a-thon was launched last with week. This year &lt;a href='http://www.healthdataconsortium.org/challenges/announcing-the-code-a-palooza-challenge-at-health-datapalooza-2014'&gt;the focus&lt;/a&gt; is on how independant developers can leverage the massive &lt;a href='https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Physician-and-Other-Supplier.html'&gt;CMS patient claims and physician reimbursement data&lt;/a&gt; recently released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already many journalists and &lt;a href='http://omni.docgraph.org/'&gt;health data junkies&lt;/a&gt; have already started pouring through the nearly 9 million records looking for trends and insights that may benefit patients, payers and providers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s official, I have started a team as well and we are beginning to kick around ideas, looking at data sets and talking logistics. Transparency is the name of the game, so I’ll be writing when I can about our experiences, insights, questions, tools, technology, and well, everything. I’m particularly excited for the technical journey, and documenting that as much as possible so others may follow our path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a few goals in mind, beyond pure health data discovery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have Fun: It’s important to show others, especially non-health-data-geeks that this can be an enjoyable initiative. Yes, we nerd out, but it’s not all TNG and pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be Democratic: Also important is educating others so that this may be accomplished by “normal” people. We are not professional programmers exactly, but we do have a vested interest in data. We feel it’s important to highlight that together our different backgrounds can create a whole greater than the sum of our parts, and that the tools used to accomplish this are widely available to the greater public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn Something: Me? I need to brush up on R, and webdev. Nick is a complete newb to the healthcare scene. Mandi is looking forward to technical nuts and bolts. We all have vastly different backgrounds and talents, and it will be interesting to feed off of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide Value: Core to this initiative is the opportunity to provide real value and insight to the greater healthcare community and the patients involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win Big: Let’s be honest, now, cash money potential has crossed our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, we are pretty open. There’s a lot to discover, and we will take the next two weeks kicking around broad hypothesis before narrowing things down for a formal proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to expand more on our team, and what everyone brings to the table, but for now, meet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align='center'&gt;

&lt;img src='/images/mandi.jpg' /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Mandi Bishop&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hardcore data geek with a Masters from FSU, and a passion for analytics, Mandi fell in love with BASIC and her PCjr early on. She continues to be a patient engagement advocate, health IT innovator and dreamer. Mandi is currently in Jacksonville, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src='/images/nick.jpg' /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Nick Kypreos&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A music school dropout, Nick pursued a PhD in Physics from UF. Eventually working as a data scientist with CERN, Microsoft and Amazon, he now hacks on challenging data sets. For fun. In R. Nick is currently in Seattle, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src='/images/lauren.jpg' /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lauren Still&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack of all trades, master of some, Lauren is a health IT generalist. Currently handling all things policy related for DICOMGrid, she fills her days talking to compliancy cats and avoiding picture opportunities. Lauren is currently in San Francisco, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

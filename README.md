We are taking another direction stack-wise with the actually app portion of the project and will eventually migrate the content and blog over to the new platform, but for now this will stay as is.  

The #TeamFlorida app will still be located at teamfloriduh/com/app but will just be split off behind the scenes (r/python/djanjo instead of ruby).
